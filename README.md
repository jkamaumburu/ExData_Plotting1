The plots are to be executed one at a time.

The assumption is that I was working on a windows machine so the working directory would need to be set appropirately for non windows users.

After executing each plot(n).R, there will be a png file in the working directory that corresponds to what we were expected to do.

More instructions/documentation is in the actual R files for each plot.

Thanks.
